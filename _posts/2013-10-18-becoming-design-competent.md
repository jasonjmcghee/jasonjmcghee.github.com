      I've recently come to realize the importance of a full stack engineer's ability to design well. 
      From my first day at UCB, I've been surrounded by students constantly bashing designers 
      and writing them off as inadequate engineers (if even engineers at all). Looking back, it 
      seems ridiculous to me. From a real world perspective, the better the design of the product 
      or service, both structurally (in the code) and aesthetically (or what the end-user sees) the 
      more successful it will be. Developers will have an easier time contributing and consolidating 
      code, and the customers- well, generally the customers are not going to understand what's 
      going on behind the scenes. What they are exposed to, is the <i>design</i> of the website. 
      Their experience almost entirely depends on the UX (hence the name) and, of course, the 
      aesthetic appeal of what's in front of them.</p>

    <div class="pcontent" style="display: none">
      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
      This leads my to my next point: the presentation of the product, or service, is vital.
      Even if it's directed towards developers (even if you're designing an API or a service
      to help develop an infrastructure) the attractiveness of the website or front-end,
      I can confidently say, will have a positive correlation with the success of the product.
      By no means do I claim design is any more important than the actual product or 
      service, but people respond to usability and beauty. It amazes me how few classes are
      offered at UCB, and other universities, which support learning how to design. I mean
      really design, not just how to write CSS and JS. As a result, students like me have 
      only the experience and knowledge gained from frequenting blogs and exploring open
      source code.</p>

      Personally, I've spent time learning SASS, which I find incredibly useful, Photoshop,
      which is uncontested for building mockups and style guides, and JavaScript, along with
      a number of libraries which provide developers with a whole lot of freedom in design and the
      development of clean, interactive web applications. After everything, I find my design 
      skills to be rather lacking. I know they'll improve with experience, but I'm getting
      impatient! So I'll continue to polish them in my own time and at future internships, 
      to the best of my ability, despite the informal nature which involves becoming competant 
      in design.

        Each day I find myself realizing the amount of knowledge I have yet to acquire, which only
        inspires me to strive to learn all that I can. I've now held jobs working on front-end
        web development, back-end development, and development operations. Although I haven't
        decided what my focus will be, (which I think is just fine, I haven't even graduated yet)
        I understand the importance of great design and I'll be returning to working hard to 
        build and polish my skills across the stack (as opposed to focusing primarily on the
        back-end). Nothing would please me more than to gain the ability to design a website or web
        application which would personally impress me (especially aesthetically). This was
        a rather personal blog post- so I'll probably get back into the more technical aspects
        of my pursuit of knowledge as time goes on.
